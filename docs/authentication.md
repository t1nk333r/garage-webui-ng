# Authentication

The canonical reference for how Garage WebUI-NG authenticates and authorises
people. The README links here rather than duplicating any of it.

Upgrading an existing deployment? Read [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md) first.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Users are application data, not configuration.** They live in a small
  SQLite database owned by the app, and are managed entirely from the UI.
- **Authentication is mandatory.** There is no open (no-auth) mode. Every API
  route requires a session except the three listed under
  [Public endpoints](#61-public-endpoints).
- **Nothing needs to be edited after the first start.** Creating, renaming,
  re-roling, disabling or deleting an account never involves an environment
  variable, a config file or a restart.
- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt (cost 10)**. **No endpoint ever returns a
  password or a password hash** — see [§6.5](#65-no-endpoint-returns-a-password).

The database is the only state this service owns. Everything else it shows you
is read live from your Garage cluster.

---

## 2. First run — the setup wizard

A deployment with **zero** users is *un-set-up*. In that state:

- `GET /api/auth/status` and `GET /api/setup/status` both report
  `needsSetup: true`;
- the SPA redirects every route — including `/auth/login` — to **`/setup`**;
- the server logs, at startup:
  `No users configured — open http://<host>:<port>/setup to create the first administrator.`

The wizard asks for exactly three things: **username**, **password**, and
**confirm password**. It creates one account, always with the **`admin`** role.

Finishing the wizard **signs you straight in** (the server issues a fresh
session token and stores the identity), so you land in the app rather than on a
login form.

The wizard then closes **permanently**: `POST /api/setup` refuses with **409
Conflict** (`setup has already been completed`) as soon as any user exists, and
the check happens inside the same database transaction as the insert, so two
concurrent requests cannot both succeed. Deleting every user is not a supported
way to reopen it — see [Lockout & recovery](#9-lockout--recovery).

### Validation rules

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Username | 1–64 characters, `A–Z a–z 0–9 . _ @ -` only. Case-**insensitive** uniqueness: `Admin` and `admin` are the same account. |
| Password | At least **10** characters, at most **72 bytes** (bcrypt ignores anything beyond that, so a longer password is rejected rather than silently truncated), and not entirely whitespace. |

The browser validates the same rules for a faster round trip; the server
validates independently and is authoritative.

---

## 3. Database & persistence

| | |
|---|---|
| Env var | `DB_PATH` |
| Default in the Docker image | `/data/garage-webui-ng.db` |
| Default elsewhere (binary, `go run`) | `./data/garage-webui-ng.db`, relative to the working directory |
| Driver | `modernc.org/sqlite` — pure Go, no cgo |
| Journal mode | WAL (so `-wal` and `-shm` sidecar files sit next to the database) |

**A persistent volume is required.** Losing the file loses every account and
drops the instance back to the setup wizard. The container declares
`VOLUME ["/data"]` and the Compose stack mounts a named volume `webui_data`
there for exactly this reason.

The runtime image is distroless `nonroot`: the process runs as **uid/gid
65532**, and the image ships a `/data` directory already owned by that uid.
Docker seeds a fresh named volume from the image directory, so the volume
inherits the ownership and the non-root process can create its database. If you
bind-mount a host directory instead, **chown it to `65532:65532` yourself** —
otherwise startup fails with `cannot open user database`.

Startup is fail-fast: if the database cannot be opened or migrated, the process
exits rather than serving a UI that could only return errors. On a successful
start it logs the path it used:

```
User database: /data/garage-webui-ng.db
```

---

## 4. Schema

One table plus a version counter. Migrations are **append-only**: each entry is
a schema version, its index+1 is the number recorded in `schema_migrations`, and
a shipped entry is never edited, reordered or removed — the counter is the only
record of what a live database already has, so an edited entry would silently
never be applied to existing installs. Each migration runs in its own
transaction together with its version bump, so a failure cannot leave a
half-applied version behind.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);

-- migration 1
CREATE TABLE users (
    id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username      TEXT    NOT NULL UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE,
    password_hash TEXT    NOT NULL,
    role          TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT 'admin',
    disabled      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login    TIMESTAMP
);
```

Notes:

- `COLLATE NOCASE` on `username` makes the UNIQUE index case-insensitive, which
  is what operators expect from a login name and blocks look-alike duplicates.
- `updated_at` tracks **administrative** changes to the account. A successful
  sign-in stamps `last_login` only, deliberately leaving `updated_at` alone.
- `disabled` accounts keep their row (and their history); they simply cannot
  sign in.
- The connection pool is capped at **one** connection. SQLite permits a single
  writer, this database holds a handful of rows, and funnelling every statement
  through one connection removes “database is locked” as a failure mode.

---

## 5. Roles

Two roles: **`admin`** and **`viewer`**.

### `admin`

Full access: everything a viewer can do, plus every write, plus user
administration under `/api/admin/*`.

### `viewer` — read-only, fail-closed

The role is defined by an allowlist, not a denylist:

- **Everything under `/api/admin/` is denied outright**, whatever the method.
  Reads included: the roster of accounts, their roles and their sign-in times
  are not viewer-visible information.
- **Every other `GET` is allowed**, with one carve-out: `GET /api/v2/GetKeyInfo`
  with `showSecretKey=true` is denied, so a viewer can never reveal a secret
  access key.
- **Exactly three writes are permitted:** `POST /api/auth/logout` and
  `POST /api/auth/change-password` act solely on the caller's own session and
  own account; `POST /api/browse/download-token` mints a short-lived token
  authorising a multi-object ZIP download — it is a POST only because the
  selected key list is too large for a URL, and it mutates nothing, so a
  read-only viewer may call it. Each is an exact path match, not a prefix.
- Every other method (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, …) is denied with
  **403** `forbidden: read-only session`.

A denied request is still recorded by the audit log, with its `403` status.

The administration API is guarded **twice, independently**: the middleware
refuses `/admin/` for a viewer, and every `/admin/*` handler additionally calls
`requireAdmin` before doing anything. A routing mistake alone cannot expose
those endpoints. Keep both.

---

## 6. API reference

All paths are relative to the server root and are served under `/api`
(prefixed by `BASE_PATH` when that is set). Successful responses are JSON;
**error responses are a plain-text message body** with the status code below.

### 6.1 Public endpoints

Exactly three routes are reachable without a session. The list is
exact-match — never a prefix — and is a security boundary.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/auth/status` | Session state + whether setup is still needed. |
| `GET` | `/api/setup/status` | Whether setup is still needed. |
| `POST` | `/api/setup` | Create the first administrator (only while there are none). |

`POST /api/auth/login` is registered ahead of the middleware chain and so is
also reachable without a session, by construction.

### 6.2 Setup

| | |
|---|---|
| **`GET /api/setup/status`** | |
| Auth | none |
| Request | — |
| Success | `200` · `{"needsSetup": true}` |
| Errors | `500` — the user count could not be read. While startup is still in progress the answer is `{"needsSetup": true}`; the wizard's own guard, not this answer, decides whether an account can actually be created. |

| | |
|---|---|
| **`POST /api/setup`** | |
| Auth | none — but only succeeds while the users table is empty |
| CSRF | exempt |
| Request | `{"username": "...", "password": "...", "confirmPassword": "..."}` |
| Success | `200` · `{"authenticated": true, "username": "...", "role": "admin"}` — and the caller is signed in |
| `400` | `invalid request body`, `passwords do not match`, or a validation message (`password is not acceptable: …`, `invalid username: …`, `"x" is already taken`) |
| `409` | `setup has already been completed` — the instance already has a user; the wizard is closed for good |
| `429` | `too many setup attempts, try again later` |
| `500` | store unavailable, or the account could not be created |

### 6.3 Session

| | |
|---|---|
| **`POST /api/auth/login`** | |
| Auth | none |
| CSRF | exempt |
| Request | `{"username": "...", "password": "..."}` |
| Success | `200` · `{"authenticated": true, "username": "...", "role": "admin"\|"viewer"}` |
| `401` | `invalid username or password` — returned identically for an unknown user, a disabled account and a wrong password, and a disabled/unknown account still pays for a bcrypt comparison so the timing matches |
| `429` | `too many login attempts, try again later` |
| `500` | invalid JSON body, store unavailable, or the session could not be started |

The response reports the **stored** spelling of the username, not what was
typed — logins are case-insensitive and the session and audit log should show
one canonical form. Login renews the session token before recording the
identity, so a session ID planted before authentication cannot become an
authenticated one.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`POST /api/auth/logout`** | |
| Auth | any authenticated session (including `viewer`) |
| CSRF | **required** |
| Request | — |
| Success | `200` · `true` |
| Errors | `401` unauthenticated · `403` missing/invalid CSRF token |

| | |
|---|---|
| **`GET /api/auth/status`** | |
| Auth | none |
| Success | `200` · `{"enabled": true, "authenticated": bool, "username": "...", "role": "...", "needsSetup": bool}` |
| Errors | `500` — the user count could not be read |

`enabled` is a constant `true` (authentication is mandatory); the field is kept
because the frontend still reads it. `username` and `role` are empty strings on
an unauthenticated session. This endpoint reveals nothing beyond the caller's
own session state and whether a first account is still needed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`POST /api/auth/change-password`** | |
| Auth | any authenticated session (including `viewer`) |
| CSRF | **required** |
| Request | `{"currentPassword": "...", "newPassword": "...", "confirmPassword": "..."}` |
| Success | `200` · `true` |
| `400` | `invalid request body`, `passwords do not match`, `the new password must differ from the current one`, or `password is not acceptable: …` |
| `401` | no session, the session names an account that no longer exists or has been disabled, or `current password is incorrect` |
| `403` | missing/invalid CSRF token |
| `429` | `too many attempts, try again later` |
| `500` | store unavailable, or the password could not be stored |

The body carries **no user id**: the endpoint always acts on whoever the session
names, so it can never target another account. Verifying the current password
is a password guess like any other, so it shares the login rate limiter — the
check runs *before* the comparison, otherwise a stolen session would be an
unthrottled oracle for the password it could not otherwise read. A successful
change renews the session token while keeping the caller signed in.

### 6.4 User administration

Every route below requires an **`admin`** session and a valid CSRF token on
writes. A viewer receives `403 forbidden: read-only session` from the
middleware; anything else that reaches a handler without the admin role gets
`403 forbidden: administrator role required`.

A **user object** is:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "alice",
  "role": "admin",
  "disabled": false,
  "createdAt": "2026-08-04T09:15:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-04T09:15:00Z",
  "lastLogin": "2026-08-04T10:02:11Z"
}
```

`lastLogin` is `null` for an account that has never signed in. There is no
password field of any kind.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`GET /api/admin/users`** | |
| Request | — |
| Success | `200` · array of user objects, ordered by username |
| Errors | `401` · `403` · `500` |

| | |
|---|---|
| **`POST /api/admin/users`** | |
| CSRF | required |
| Request | `{"username": "...", "password": "...", "role": "admin"\|"viewer"}` |
| Success | `200` · the created user object |
| `400` | `invalid request body`, `invalid role: …`, `invalid username: …`, `password is not acceptable: …` |
| `409` | `"x" is already taken` |
| Errors | `401` · `403` · `500` |

| | |
|---|---|
| **`PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}`** | |
| CSRF | required |
| Request | any subset of `{"username": "...", "role": "...", "disabled": bool}`. Fields are optional pointers, so *absent* differs from *empty*: `{}` is a no-op, `{"username": ""}` is a rejected rename. |
| Success | `200` · the updated user object |
| `400` | `invalid user id`, `invalid request body`, `invalid role: …`, `invalid username: …` |
| `404` | `user not found` |
| `409` | `"x" is already taken`, or a lockout guard (see [§7](#7-lockout-guards)) |
| Errors | `401` · `403` · `500` |

| | |
|---|---|
| **`DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}`** | |
| CSRF | required |
| Request | — |
| Success | `200` · `true` |
| `400` | `invalid user id` |
| `404` | `user not found` |
| `409` | a lockout guard (see [§7](#7-lockout-guards)) |
| Errors | `401` · `403` · `500` |

| | |
|---|---|
| **`POST /api/admin/users/{id}/reset-password`** | |
| CSRF | required |
| Request | `{"newPassword": "..."}` |
| Success | `200` · `true` |
| `400` | `invalid user id`, `invalid request body`, `password is not acceptable: …` |
| `404` | `user not found` |
| Errors | `401` · `403` · `500` |

An administrator resetting someone else's password does **not** need the old
one — that is the escape hatch for a locked-out colleague. Resetting the
password does not by itself end the target's existing sessions — the password
hash is not part of what a session is revalidated against — so if a session
must be cut off, disable or delete the account (or demote it) instead.

Every authenticated request is revalidated against the user store, not just
trusted from the session established at login: disabling, deleting or
changing an account's role takes effect within 5 seconds — a short cache
(`backend/middleware/auth.go`) that keeps that check off the single-connection
SQLite pool — rather than instantly. That is a bounded delay, not instant
revocation, but it is a world away from the 24-hour session lifetime a purely
session-based check would otherwise allow.

Renames and password resets never remove administrative access, so the lockout
guards never block them.

### 6.5 No endpoint returns a password

`store.User.PasswordHash` carries `json:"-"`, which is the single guarantee that
a hash cannot leak through any response, and the tests assert on raw response
bodies that no bcrypt prefix ever appears. No handler logs a submitted password
either — JSON decoder errors are replaced with a flat `invalid request body`
precisely because the decoder can quote the request body, which is where the
password is.

---

## 7. Lockout guards

Three rules stop the instance from becoming unadministrable. Each returns
**409 Conflict** with the message shown, and the write does not happen. A
failure to *evaluate* a rule fails closed as a `500` — an unreadable admin count
must never be read as “there are plenty of admins”.

| Rule | Message |
|---|---|
| An admin may not delete their own account. | `you cannot delete your own account` |
| An admin may not demote or disable their own account — even when other admins exist, because a one-click accidental lockout is too easy. | `you cannot demote or disable your own account` |
| Nobody may take administration away from the last **enabled** admin (delete, disable, or demote to viewer). | `cannot remove the last administrator: this instance would become unadministrable` |

Identity comes from the session, never from the request body, and is compared
case-insensitively to match the `COLLATE NOCASE` username index.

The Users tab greys out actions these rules would refuse, but that is a
courtesy, not a control — the server answers 409 regardless and the UI shows the
message verbatim.

---

## 8. Sessions & CSRF

### Session cookie

Sessions are server-side ([`alexedwards/scs`](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs));
the cookie carries only an opaque token.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| `HttpOnly` | `true` — set explicitly, so a library default change cannot weaken it |
| `SameSite` | `Lax` — likewise explicit |
| `Secure` | `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (default `false`) |
| `Path` | `/`, or `BASE_PATH` when the UI is mounted under a prefix |

`Secure` is opt-in because browsers reject `Secure` cookies over plain HTTP and
this UI is commonly served over HTTP on a private network. **Set
`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` whenever you terminate TLS in front of it.**

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_LIFETIME_HOURS` | `24` | Absolute cap on a session's age, counted from creation. Reached even by a session in constant use. |
| `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_HOURS` | `2` | Signs out a session that has not been touched for this long. |

Both take a positive whole number of hours. A value that is unparseable or
`<= 0` falls back to the default and logs a warning rather than silently running
with a different expiry.

Session data is held **in memory**, so restarting the process signs everyone
out. Accounts are unaffected — those are in the database.

The token is renewed on login, on completing setup, and after a password change,
so a session ID planted before a privilege change never becomes a privileged one.

### CSRF double-submit token

| | |
|---|---|
| Cookie | `csrf_token` — 32 random bytes, hex-encoded. Deliberately **not** `HttpOnly`: the frontend has to read it. Mirrors the session cookie's `Path`, `SameSite=Lax` and `Secure`. |
| Header | `X-CSRF-Token` — must equal the cookie on every state-changing request |

Any request without the cookie is issued one, so a fresh client picks up its
token on the first `GET`. `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS` are never rejected.
`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` are rejected with **403** `invalid or missing CSRF
token` unless the pair matches (compared in constant time).

**Only two endpoints are exempt**, as exact method+path matches:
`POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/setup` — the only writes a caller can make
before it holds any session or token at all. Both are rate-limited and both are
guarded by a credential or by the "no users exist yet" check. Every other write,
including logout and password change, requires the token.

Honest framing: the session cookie is already `SameSite=Lax` and the API
consumes `application/json`, so a cross-site form post cannot reach a write
endpoint with credentials attached anyway. The token is defence in depth on top
of those two — do not relax `SameSite` or add permissive CORS to accommodate it.

### Login rate limiting

**10 attempts per minute per client IP**, a fixed window. Exceeding it returns
**429**. The bucket is shared by `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/setup`, and
the current-password check inside `POST /api/auth/change-password`.

The key is the peer address (`RemoteAddr`). `X-Forwarded-For` is deliberately
**not** trusted: without knowing the proxy topology, honouring it would let a
client choose its own rate-limit bucket. Behind a reverse proxy every attempt
therefore shares one bucket — size your fronting proxy's own rate limiting
accordingly.

---

## 9. Lockout & recovery

Losing every administrator credential cannot be fixed *from inside the app*: the
setup wizard only reopens when there are **zero** users, and the lockout guards
exist precisely to stop you reaching a state with no working admin.

Work down this list — only step 3 destroys anything.

### Step 1 — another admin still works

Use **Settings → Users → Reset password** on the locked-out account. Nothing
else in this section applies.

### Step 2 — you have shell access: the recovery CLI

The same binary that serves the UI carries three offline recovery flags. They
read and write the SQLite database at `DB_PATH` directly, **lose no data**, and
work even when every password is forgotten.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-list-users` | Print every account: username, role, status, last login, created. Never prints a password or a hash. |
| `-reset-password <username>` | Prompt for a new password and store it on that account. |
| `-create-admin <username>` | Prompt for a password and create a new **admin**. Works even when accounts already exist — unlike `POST /setup`. |

```bash
# systemd / bare binary — run as the service user so the new file ownership
# and the database's own permissions stay correct.
sudo -u garage-webui DB_PATH=/var/lib/garage-webui-ng/garage-webui-ng.db \
  /usr/local/bin/garage-webui-ng -list-users

sudo -u garage-webui DB_PATH=/var/lib/garage-webui-ng/garage-webui-ng.db \
  /usr/local/bin/garage-webui-ng -reset-password admin

# Docker — -it is required, otherwise there is no terminal to prompt on.
docker run -it --rm -v garage-webui-ng_webui_data:/data \
  --entrypoint /main ghcr.io/d7eeem/garage-webui-ng:latest -reset-password admin

# ...or against the running container.
docker compose exec webui /main -list-users
```

Output looks like this — note that no hash appears anywhere:

```
USERNAME  ROLE    STATUS  LAST LOGIN            CREATED
admin     admin   active  2026-08-04 09:12:44Z  2026-06-01 10:02:11Z
reader    viewer  active  -                     2026-06-01 10:04:02Z
```

What these commands are, and are not:

- **They are not HTTP endpoints, and never will be.** An unauthenticated
  password reset reachable over the network is a backdoor. These are process
  flags that require local read/write access to `DB_PATH` — anyone who can run
  them could already edit the database file by hand, so they grant no new
  capability.
- **The password is never a command-line argument.** It is prompted for with
  terminal echo disabled and asked twice, so it never reaches your shell
  history, `ps` output or process accounting. For scripted recovery a single
  line piped on stdin is accepted instead (`printf '%s\n' "$NEW" | … -reset-password admin`),
  which skips the confirmation prompt — mind your history settings if you do
  that.
- **They enforce the same password policy as the UI** (§2), because they call
  the same validation code.
- **Stopping the service is not required.** WAL mode plus a busy timeout makes
  the concurrent write safe, and credentials are read per-login rather than
  cached, so a reset takes effect on the next sign-in. Stopping it anyway is
  the conservative choice and costs nothing.
- **Existing sessions are not signed out.** Sessions live in memory (§8); a
  password change — from the CLI or the UI — does not revoke one already
  established.
- **They run schema migrations**, like the server does. Pointing them at an old
  backup copy upgrades that copy.

### Step 3 — last resort: reset the database

Only if you have no shell access to the host at all.

1. **Stop** the container / process.
2. Remove the database from the volume — the file at `DB_PATH` **and its WAL
   sidecars**:
   ```bash
   docker compose stop webui
   docker run --rm -v garage-webui-ng_webui_data:/data busybox \
     sh -c 'rm -f /data/garage-webui-ng.db /data/garage-webui-ng.db-wal /data/garage-webui-ng.db-shm'
   docker compose start webui
   ```
   (Adjust the volume name to match your stack — `docker volume ls` shows it.)
3. Reopen the UI. `needsSetup` is `true` again and the wizard asks for a new
   administrator.

> **This deletes every account**, including viewers, along with their creation
> and last-login history. Nothing else is affected: buckets, keys and objects
> live in Garage, not here.

---

## 10. Legacy import (`AUTH_USER_PASS`)

Pre-database releases read accounts from `AUTH_USER_PASS` and
`AUTH_VIEWER_USER_PASS` on every request. They are now an **import-only** path,
kept so an existing deployment survives the upgrade:

- They are read **exactly once**, at startup, and **only when the users table is
  empty**. After that the database is authoritative and the variables are never
  consulted again — editing them has no effect.
- Format is unchanged: comma-separated `username:bcrypt-hash` entries; within an
  entry the **first** `:` splits the two (bcrypt hashes contain neither `:` nor
  `,`). Malformed entries are skipped.
- Only `$2a$`, `$2b$` and `$2y$` hashes are accepted; anything else is skipped
  with a log line naming the user (never the hash).
- Hashes are stored **verbatim** — re-hashing them would lock every existing
  operator out.
- Admins are imported before viewers, so a name present in both variables lands
  as an admin and its viewer entry is dropped.
- Legacy usernames are **not** checked against the current username charset, so
  an existing login keeps working even if the app would no longer hand it out.
- On a successful import the server logs:
  `Initial administrator imported from AUTH_USER_PASS (N user(s)).`

Once you have logged in, **remove the variables** from your compose file or unit
— see [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md), which explains the one trap worth knowing
about (keeping them *and* running without a volume).

---

## 11. Not implemented (future extension points)

None of the following exists today. They are recorded so the shape of the schema
and the API is understood as deliberate, not accidental.

- **Fine-grained RBAC.** The `role` column holds one of two strings. A richer
  model would add `roles` and `permissions` tables and a join, leaving `users`
  otherwise intact; the two current values would become seeded rows.
- **MFA / TOTP.** Would add a per-user secret (and recovery codes) in a new
  migration, plus a second step between password verification and
  `Session.Renew` in the login handler.
- **OAuth / OIDC and LDAP.** Would map an external identity onto a local user
  row — the local account stays the authorisation subject, so roles, the audit
  log and the lockout guards keep working unchanged. `password_hash` would
  become optional for externally-authenticated accounts.
- **Session revocation across restarts.** Session storage is in-memory today;
  persisting it would also make “sign out everywhere” implementable.
